# Semester Project Space Race
Authors: Spencer Naugler, Carter Jeurissen

## Reflection
Spencer Naugler: The big challenge of this iteraiton was trying to get the movement system working.  
In the original game there are only movement buttons foreward and backward. 
Depending on whether the car is on the ground or not the buttons will rotate the car,
or move the car foreward and backward.

Carter Jeurissen: For me, my biggest challenge through this iteration was working on the command line in a group environment. 
Although I had grown accustomed to committing and pushing my work by myself,
I ran into multiple problems as I attempted to pull and use features such as branching.
However, I slowly have grown more confident and possess a better idea of how to properly work with others in this way.

## Self Evaluation
- [X] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.
- [X] D-2: The repository contains a README.md file in its top-level directory.
- [X] D-3: The project content is eligible for an ESRB Rating of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate .gitignore file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [] C-2: Your release is tagged using semantic versioning where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the README.md file.
- [] C-4: The README.md contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
- [X] C-5: The project content is eligible for an ESRB Rating of T or less.
- [X] C-6: The release demonstrates the core gameplay loop: the player can take actions that move them toward a goal.
- [] B-1: The README.md file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [X] B-2: The game runs without errors or warnings.
- [X] B-3: The source code and project structure comply with our adopted style guides.
- [X] B-4: Clear progress has been made on the game with respect to the project plan.
- [X] A-1: The source code contains no warnings. All warnings are properly addressed, not just ignored.
- [X] A-2: The game includes the conventional player experience loop of title, gameplay, and ending.
- [] A-3: Earn N*⌈P/2⌉ stars, where N is the iteration number and P is the number of people on the team.

# Semester Project Space Race

Authors: Spencer Naugler, Carter Jeurissen

## Reflection

Spencer Naugler: The big challenge of this iteraiton was trying to get the movement system working.  
In the original game there are only movement buttons foreward and backward.
Depending on whether the car is on the ground or not the buttons will rotate the car,
or move the car foreward and backward.

Carter Jeurissen: For me, my biggest challenge through this iteration was working on the command line in a group environment.
Although I had grown accustomed to committing and pushing my work by myself,
I ran into multiple problems as I attempted to pull and use features such as branching.
However, I slowly have grown more confident and possess a better idea of how to properly work with others in this way.

## Self Evaluation

- [x] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate .gitignore file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [] C-2: Your release is tagged using semantic versioning where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [x] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the README.md file.
- [] C-4: The README.md contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
